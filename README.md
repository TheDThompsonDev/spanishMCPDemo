## 🏗️ Architecture

### MCP Host-Client-Server Architecture
The MCP defines a three-component architecture enabling secure AI interactions between:

1. **MCP Host**: The AI application managing client-server interactions, context, and AI requests.
   - Manages connections and coordinates context between servers.
   - Handles authentication and processes AI model requests.

2. **MCP Client**: The user interface initiating requests and displaying responses.
   - Provides user-facing interfaces and manages user sessions.

3. **MCP Server**: The resource provider delivering context and data assets to the host.
   - Offers learning resources, contextual data, and domain-specific logic.

```
