## 🏗️ Architecture

### MCP Server Implementation
The server implements the full MCP specification with:

```
📁 MCP Protocol Endpoints
├── GET  /mcp/models          # List available models and capabilities
├── POST /mcp/context         # Context manipulation (get, add, update)
└── POST /mcp/generate        # Generate text with provided context

📁 Spanish Learning API
├── POST /api/translate       # English ↔ Spanish translation
├── POST /api/conjugate       # Verb conjugation
├── POST /api/query          # General Spanish learning queries
├── POST /api/session/start  # Start learning session
├── POST /api/session/end    # End learning session
├── GET  /api/session/:id    # Get session details
└── GET  /api/progress       # User progress tracking
```

### Context Types
The MCP server supports multiple context types:

- **`vocabulary`**: Spanish vocabulary with translations and examples
- **`grammar`**: Grammar rules, verb conjugations, and usage patterns
- **`conversation`**: Common phrases and conversational patterns
- **`mixed`**: Combined vocabulary and grammar context
- **`exercise`**: Practice exercises and learning activities
- **`assessment`**: Skill assessment and evaluation content
- **`personalized`**: User-specific content based on learning progress

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- Modern web browser

### Installation

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Build the React frontend:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Start the MCP server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Open your browser:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3001
   ```

### Development Mode

For frontend development with hot reload:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the backend server
node server.js

# Terminal 2: Start the frontend development server
npm run dev
```

Frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`
Backend API at `http://localhost:3001`

## 🔄 MCP Flow Demonstration

The demo showcases the complete MCP flow:

### 1. Client Request
```javascript
POST /mcp/generate
{
  "prompt": "Translate to Spanish: Hello, how are you?",
  "context_type": "vocabulary",
  "model": "spanish-learning-model"
}
```

### 2. Context Retrieval
```javascript
POST /mcp/context
{
  "context_type": "vocabulary",
  "operation": "get",
  "categories": ["greeting"],
  "difficulty_level": "beginner"
}
```

### 3. AI Model Processing
The server processes the request with retrieved context, enhancing the AI model's understanding of Spanish vocabulary and appropriate translations.

### 4. Response Generation
```javascript
{
  "object": "generation",
  "model": "spanish-learning-model",
  "choices": [{
    "text": "Hola, ¿cómo estás?",
    "finish_reason": "stop"
  }],
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 10,
    "completion_tokens": 7,
    "total_tokens": 17
  }
}
```
